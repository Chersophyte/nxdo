## Code for XDO: A Double Oracle Algorithm for Extensive-Form Games


Included are Deep RL implementations for NXDO, PSRO/P2SRO, and NFSP.

For RL, we build on top of [RLlib](https://docs.ray.io/en/master/rllib.html). However, much of the code for [NXDO](grl/algos/xfdo) and [PSRO](grl/algos/p2sro) is agnostic to the RL implementation.

Check this [repo](https://github.com/indylab/tabular_xdo) for tabular experiment code.
